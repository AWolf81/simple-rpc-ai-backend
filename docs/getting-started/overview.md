# Project Overview

The Simple RPC AI Backend exposes a tRPC-powered API that implements the Model Context Protocol for AI assistants. It provides:

- **Unified provider orchestration** across Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and custom registries.
- **MCP tooling and resource access** so assistants can browse workspaces, call tools, and retrieve documents.
- **Production-ready ergonomics** including workspace isolation, provider health checks, and registry fallbacks.
